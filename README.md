 <h3>My name is Ervin, I'm a Computer Science Engineering student at UCI^'25^. I'm from Sicily, Italy, but currently live in Irivne, CA.   </h3>
There are many technologies that excites out there, such as blockchain, Deep Learning, quantum computing, robotics and much more! I'm inspired to become a software engineer with main area of interest in Computer Vision. 
I see Computer Science as a Tool to realize incredible products rather than well defined box. I believe that creativity is the engine for the world, and for this we should never stop it!
